# Vimfest 2017

This is my contribution to Vimfest 2017, Berlin. I gave a short talk on "Neovim â€“ the Historian's Best Friend" in which I presented some mappings and plug-ins I find most useful when dealing with text.

## Presentation

In order to view the slides in Vim or Neovim you should install two plug-ins: [Presenting](https://github.com/sotte/presenting.vim) and [Goyo](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim). Open the `slides.md` in your favorite text editor and start the presentation with `:PresentingStart` followed `:Goyo`.

## Talk

The talk was written in Pandoc's markdown to transfer its content easily to other formats.
